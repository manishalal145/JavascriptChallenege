This assignment was to write code that will create a table dynamically based upon the dataset provided (about Alien UFO sightings). The table should allow users to filter the table data for specific values.

Requirements
Level 1 - Automatic Table and Data Search  
     -	Created a basic HTML web page or use the index.html file provided.     
     -	Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, written the code that appends a table to our web page and then adds new rows           of data for each UFO sighting.     
     -	Used a date form in our HTML document and written the JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that         match user input.   

Level 2 - Multiple Search Categories       
Using multiple input tags, wrote JavaScript code so that user can set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:    
       -	date/time      
       -	city    
       -	state   
       -	country        
       -	shape
